# Project-Zeus
Purpose: an entry to the ECES-IECEP UE-Caloocan ASICUP Competition

An advanced 6-channel line follower engineered to navigate complex tracks with zigzags, intersections, and dashed lines using pure logic control instead of PID. Its rule-based programming ensures consistent, precise, and 100% accurate line detection and path completion, showcasing efficient algorithmic design and sensor coordination.

Details of project construction are demonstrated on the Wiki section of this repository.
