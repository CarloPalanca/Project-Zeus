# Project-Zeus
An advanced 6-channel line follower engineered to navigate complex tracks with zigzags, intersections, and dashed lines using pure logic control instead of PID. Its rule-based programming ensures consistent, precise, and 100% accurate line detection and path completion, showcasing efficient algorithmic design and sensor coordination.
